# shrimp-farm

Basic Node.js CRUD appliction using the Express library, Handlebars template engine, and Mongoose library to work with MongoDB.

This project requires Node.js and a MongoDB server running on port 27017.
If you don't have MongoDB, you can install it from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or pull down a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo). 

Starting from the root directory of the project, run `npm install` to install any necessary node modules, then `npm run start` to start to the application. Go to http://localhost:3000 to interact with the web UI.
